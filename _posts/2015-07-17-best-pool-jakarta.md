It's funny. Well, I guess it's true that the good things only happen at the end. Just when I start counting the day until I leave this city (Jakarta) for good, I found what I think is the best swimming pool in Jakarta.  Mind you, this comes from my small sample size, because obviously I haven't tried every single goddamn pool in Jakarta. But for me, the quality is really good.

One of my favorite activity is swimming. I used to routinely swam for three times a week. But nowadays, it's really bothersome because of the lack of transportation here in Jakarta, hence I swim just once a week now. I already seen my bright swimming future in Yogyakarta when I come there next month, simply because it's a small city, and I have my own personal transportation. Yay!
